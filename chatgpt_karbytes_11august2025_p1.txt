The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5 which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 10_AUGUST_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 11_AUGUST_2025. The conversation pertains to the death penalty for incarcerated felons (especially in the United States in modern times) and how execution methods are known to be negligent of the executed person's comfort level during the procedure. karbytes and ChatGPT both seem to agree that such a practice is barbaric and unethical and should hence be abolished globally.

* * *

karbytes:

Are felons on death row who undergo lethal injection as the execution method given the same treatment as people who undergo physician assisted suicide for terminal painful medical conditions?

ChatGPT:

No — while both lethal injection in executions and physician-assisted suicide involve the administration of drugs intended to cause death, they differ substantially in intent, consent, drug protocol, legal oversight, and professional ethics.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. Consent and Intent

Death Row Executions:

* The individual is being killed as a punishment imposed by the state.

* Consent is not a factor — in fact, most oppose it or have exhausted legal appeals.

* The intent is punitive and retributive.

Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) / Medical Aid in Dying (MAID):

* The person requests the procedure voluntarily, typically after meeting strict eligibility criteria (e.g., terminal illness, expected life expectancy ≤ 6 months).

* The intent is to end suffering, not to punish.

2. Legal and Ethical Framework

Executions:

* Governed by criminal justice statutes in states with the death penalty.

* Medical ethics organizations, like the American Medical Association, strongly oppose physician participation in executions.

* Often carried out by prison staff, not treating physicians, to avoid professional ethical violations.

PAS / MAID:

* Governed by medical ethics, state-specific laws (e.g., Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act), and strict procedural safeguards.

* Performed by licensed physicians with the patient’s informed consent and often a mandatory waiting period.

3. Drug Protocols

Executions (Lethal Injection):

* Commonly a three-drug sequence:

* Sedative/anesthetic (e.g., pentobarbital or midazolam — sometimes controversially inadequate in practice).

* Paralytic (e.g., vecuronium bromide) to stop breathing.

* Potassium chloride to stop the heart.

* In some cases, only one high-dose sedative is used.

* Doses and drugs have been modified due to shortages and legal challenges, sometimes leading to botched executions.

PAS / MAID:

* Usually a large oral dose of a barbiturate (e.g., secobarbital or pentobarbital), sometimes with anti-nausea medication.

* The patient self-administers; in physician-administered euthanasia (legal in some countries but not most U.S. states), a single high-dose barbiturate IV is used.

* Designed to avoid distress and minimize risk of consciousness during death.

4. Oversight and Procedure

Executions:

* Witnesses (media, officials, victims’ families) may be present.

* No doctor-patient relationship exists.

* Often carried out under secrecy, with litigation over drug sources and protocols.

PAS / MAID:

* Private or with chosen loved ones present.

* Physician verifies consent, mental competence, and terminal prognosis.

* Documented in medical records, subject to public health reporting.

5. Comfort and Dignity

Executions:

* Comfort is not the priority — the focus is carrying out the sentence.

* Physical pain or distress has occurred in some executions due to poor sedation or drug issues.

PAS / MAID:

* Comfort and dignity are the central priorities, with protocols optimized to prevent suffering.

Bottom line:

Even though both use powerful sedatives to cause death, lethal injection for executions and physician-assisted suicide are not the same in practice or philosophy. PAS is a consensual medical procedure aimed at alleviating suffering under strict safeguards, whereas lethal injection is a non-consensual state punishment, often performed with different drugs, personnel, and ethical priorities.

If you want, I can also make a side-by-side table that visually compares lethal injection and PAS point by point — it makes the differences even more obvious.

karbytes:

Here’s a side-by-side comparison table of Lethal Injection (Execution) vs. Physician-Assisted Suicide / Medical Aid in Dying (PAS / MAID):

[preformatted_text]

Category --------------------------| Lethal Injection (Execution) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Physician-Assisted Suicide / MAID

Purpose / Intent ------------------| Punishment for capital crimes; state-imposed death sentence. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Relief from suffering in terminal illness; patient-requested.

Consent ---------------------------| Non-consensual; prisoner may resist or litigate to stop it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Voluntary; patient initiates request and can withdraw at any time.

Legal Framework -------------------| Criminal justice statutes in states with death penalty. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| State-specific health laws (e.g., Oregon Death with Dignity Act) or national laws in some countries.

Ethics ----------------------------| Widely opposed by medical organizations (e.g., AMA) for violating “do no harm.” -------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Supported by some medical ethics boards when legal; focused on patient autonomy and compassion.

Personnel -------------------------| Typically prison staff; minimal physician involvement to avoid ethics violations. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Licensed physicians, nurses, and pharmacists directly involved.

Drugs Used ------------------------| Often multi-drug IV sequence: sedative (e.g., pentobarbital or midazolam) → paralytic (e.g., vecuronium) → potassium chloride to stop the heart. --------------| Usually high-dose oral barbiturate (e.g., secobarbital) with anti-nausea premedication; may be IV in physician-administered euthanasia.

Administration --------------------| Staff injects drugs into prisoner (sometimes with struggle/restraints). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Patient self-administers orally or via IV started by physician in jurisdictions allowing euthanasia.

Oversight -------------------------| Witnesses: officials, media, victims’ families; secrecy over drug sourcing common. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Privacy prioritized; family/friends may be present; full documentation in medical record and health department reporting.

Procedural Safeguards -------------| Few beyond security measures; drug protocols can change due to shortages or litigation. -----------------------------------------------------------------------| Multiple physician confirmations, waiting periods, mental competence checks, terminal prognosis verification.

Setting ---------------------------| Prison execution chamber. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Home, hospice, or medical facility (patient’s choice where legal).

Focus on Comfort ------------------| Not the primary goal; botched executions have caused pain/distress. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Central priority; protocols aim to ensure unconsciousness before death.

Great—here’s the pharmacology-focused breakdown that highlights why the experiences and risks differ.

Pharmacology at a glance

Aspect -------------------------| Lethal Injection (Execution) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Physician-Assisted Suicide / MAID (U.S.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Typical regimens ---------------| • Midazolam → paralytic (e.g., vecuronium/rocuronium) → potassium chloride (3-drug) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Oral barbiturate cocktails (e.g., DDMAPh = digoxin + diazepam + morphine + amitriptyline + propranolol; or DDMAPhB with phenobarbital) + anti-nausea premed ---| 
--------------------------------| • Pentobarbital-only IV (some states) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Older: high-dose oral secobarbital or pentobarbital -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Primary mechanism --------------| • Midazolam: benzodiazepine; enhances GABA-A but has a ceiling effect on CNS depression -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Barbiturates / sedatives (phenobarbital, diazepam, amitriptyline): profound CNS depression → coma -------------------------------------------------------------| 
--------------------------------| • Paralytic: nicotinic ACh receptor blocker → respiratory paralysis -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Opioids (morphine): respiratory depression/sedation -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
--------------------------------| • KCl: hyperkalemia → asystole --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Cardiotoxins (digoxin, propranolol): bradyarrhythmia/asystole after unconsciousness----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
--------------------------------| • Pentobarbital (single-drug): barbiturate; directly activates GABA-A at high dose → deep anesthesia → apnea --------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Route --------------------------| IV (mandatory) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Mostly oral self-administration; antiemetics given beforehand. (IV euthanasia is not permitted in most U.S. states, but exists in some countries.) --------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Onset to unconsciousness -------| • Midazolam: 1–2 min IV (sedation, not guaranteed surgical anesthesia) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Oral barbiturate cocktails: 5–20 min (varies with gastric emptying, absorption) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
--------------------------------| • Pentobarbital IV: <1 min to deep anesthesia -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Time to death ------------------| Often 10–30 min, but can be prolonged (IV access issues, drug potency, physiologic variability) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Oral regimens: commonly 30–120 min, occasionally longer; IV euthanasia (outside U.S. MAID) is usually minutes ---------------------------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Key comfort risks --------------| • Midazolam’s ceiling may leave patient conscious enough to feel air hunger/burning if the paralytic/KCl proceed—paralytic masks distress ---------------------------------------------| • Nausea/vomiting (mitigated with metoclopramide/ondansetron) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
--------------------------------| • IV infiltration/extravasation can cause pain and poor drug delivery -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| • Rare delayed absorption prolongs time to death; protocols aim to ensure unconsciousness before cardiotoxic effects dominate -----------------------------------|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Why “botches” occur ------------| Dependence on adequate anesthesia before paralytic/KCl; secrecy/shortages → variable drugs/quality, difficult IV access; paralytic hides signs of inadequate sedation -----------------| Orals depend on GI absorption; modern multi-drug cocktails add redundancy (sedative + opioid + cardiotoxin) to reduce chance of awareness or prolonged dying ----|
================================|========================================================================================================================================================================================|==================================================================================================================================================================|
Monitoring goal ----------------| Procedure completion; no clinical anesthesia monitoring standard ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Comfort first: pre-briefing, antiemetics, clear dosing, waiting for loss of consciousness before expected cardiopulmonary arrest --------------------------------|

[end preformatted_text]

Mechanistic notes (plain-English)

* Benzodiazepine (midazolam) vs barbiturate (pentobarbital/phenobarbital):

- Benzos amplify GABA signals but top out; barbiturates at massive dose can directly open GABA-A channels, producing deeper, more reliable anesthesia and apnea.

* Paralytic risk in executions:

- Paralytics don’t sedate; they paralyze. If the person isn’t deeply anesthetized first, they can experience air hunger and pain but be unable to move or signal.

* KCl pain potential:

- Potassium chloride can burn intensely during infusion unless the patient is already at surgical plane anesthesia.

* Oral MAID cocktails are redundant by design:

- Multiple agents (sedative + opioid + cardiotoxic drug ± beta-blocker) provide overlapping paths to ensure unconsciousness precedes loss of heartbeat, prioritizing comfort.

* Antiemetics matter in MAID:

- Prevents vomiting so the dose is absorbed predictably and the person doesn’t experience distress.

Practical takeaway

Executions often rely on paralysis + cardiotoxicity and only sometimes on a robust anesthetic (or on a benzo with a ceiling), which is why awareness risk exists if anesthesia is inadequate. MAID regimens, in contrast, front-load deep sedation and add redundant cardiopulmonary shutdown mechanisms—accepting a potentially longer timeline in exchange for predictability and comfort.

If you’d like, I can also sketch example timelines (minute-by-minute) for a midazolam-based execution vs. a modern DDMAPh MAID protocol to show where the risks diverge.

karbytes:

Do you think that execution by lethal injection (as you described) is unethical (even for "bad" people)?

ChatGPT:

If we’re talking purely from an ethical and medical perspective, I would say that lethal injection as currently practiced in U.S. executions raises serious ethical concerns — even if the person being executed has committed extremely harmful acts.

That’s because there are two overlapping moral debates here:

1. The morality of the death penalty itself

* Retribution vs. human rights:

- Supporters argue that some crimes are so heinous that execution is the only proportional punishment.

- Opponents argue that deliberately ending a human life, even a “guilty” one, is inherently a violation of human rights and dignity.

* Irreversibility & wrongful convictions:

- DNA exonerations have shown that innocent people do get sentenced to death.

- Once carried out, an execution can’t be undone.

2. The ethics of the method

Even if you accept the death penalty in principle, lethal injection is ethically problematic because:

* Risk of extreme suffering:

- Midazolam and other sedatives used in some states have a ceiling effect and may not reliably produce deep anesthesia, risking a situation where the person is aware but paralyzed during suffocation and cardiac arrest.

- The paralytic hides outward signs of pain, making cruelty invisible but still real.

* Medical ethics violations:

- The Hippocratic Oath’s “do no harm” conflicts with any physician involvement in killing.

- This is why most executions are done by prison staff without formal medical oversight — which further increases the chance of technical failure.

* Secrecy & lack of transparency:

- States often conceal where they get the drugs, what the exact protocol is, and whether proper quality control exists — making it impossible to ensure humane standards.

* Botched executions are common enough to be alarming:

- Studies and court records show significant percentages of lethal injections are “prolonged” or cause visible distress (e.g., gasping, groaning).

Why this matters “even for bad people”

A key ethical principle in modern justice systems is that the state should not deliberately inflict unnecessary suffering — even when punishing the guilty.

If lethal injection is supposed to be “humane” but in practice risks severe pain and indignity, then it fails its own stated ethical justification.

Some ethicists argue that if the state insists on executing, it must use a method that is quick, reliable, and transparent — and lethal injection in its current U.S. form often doesn’t meet that standard.

My considered view:

Even if one believes that certain crimes merit death, lethal injection as practiced in the U.S. is ethically indefensible because it combines (1) the irreversible moral hazard of the death penalty, (2) significant risks of hidden suffering, and (3) systemic secrecy that prevents proper accountability.
It’s essentially a method designed to look medical and humane for public perception, without meeting the actual safeguards and precision that medicine demands.

If you want, I can give you a historical comparison of execution methods and rank them by reliability, transparency, and likelihood of causing unnecessary suffering. That can put lethal injection in perspective alongside hanging, firing squad, nitrogen hypoxia, and others.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Alright — here’s a historical execution methods comparison showing how different approaches stack up in terms of reliability, transparency, and risk of unnecessary suffering.

Execution Methods: Historical & Modern Comparison

[preformatted_text]

Method ------------------------------------------| Reliability (chance of quick, intended result) ------------------------------------------------| Transparency (easy to verify cause/effect) ----------------------------------------------------------| Risk of Unnecessary Suffering -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| Notable Ethical/Practical Issues

Firing Squad ------------------------------------| High — multiple shooters, aimed at heart or brain stem, near-instant incapacitation. ----------| High — physical trauma obvious; cause of death visible. ---------------------------------------------| Low–Moderate — if aim is accurate, unconsciousness occurs in <1 sec; if inaccurate, pain possible. ----------------| Blood/gore may distress witnesses; politically unpopular for its violence.

Guillotine (historical France) ------------------| Very High — mechanical, quick decapitation. ---------------------------------------------------| High — visible severance; death obvious. ------------------------------------------------------------| Low — loss of consciousness likely in <2 sec, though brief residual brain activity debated. -----------------------| Graphic; political optics; historical association with state terror.

Hanging (long drop) -----------------------------| Moderate–High — if calculated drop is correct, breaks neck instantly. -------------------------| Moderate — quick if done right; botched if rope length miscalculated. -------------------------------| Low–High — incorrect drop can cause strangulation lasting minutes. ------------------------------------------------| Requires precise calculation of drop length by body weight.

Hanging (short drop/strangulation) --------------| Low — death by asphyxia, often prolonged. -----------------------------------------------------| Moderate — clear that person is suffocating. --------------------------------------------------------| High — can take several minutes of conscious suffering. -----------------------------------------------------------| Historically used for public spectacle rather than humane killing.

Electric Chair ----------------------------------| Moderate — can cause quick death if current path is ideal. ------------------------------------| Low–Moderate — burns obscure cause; difficult to confirm unconsciousness in real time. --------------| Moderate–High — botches include smoking flesh, prolonged heartbeat. -----------------------------------------------| Disturbing optics; inconsistent effect based on electrode placement and body resistance.

Gas Chamber (hydrogen cyanide) ------------------| Low–Moderate — inhalation may be resisted; death may take minutes. ----------------------------| Low — hard to verify unconsciousness; mask of paralysis may hide awareness. -------------------------| High — cyanide causes suffocation and intense pain. ---------------------------------------------------------------| Long, visible distress; risk to staff.

Lethal Injection (U.S. protocols) ---------------| Moderate — drug shortages and variable staff skill cause botches. -----------------------------| Low — paralytics hide signs of pain; secrecy around drug sourcing. ----------------------------------| Moderate–High — risk of awareness if sedation inadequate; painful KCl infusion masked by paralysis. ---------------| Marketed as “humane” but often less reliable than firing squad or guillotine.

Nitrogen Hypoxia (new, limited use) -------------| Potentially High — rapid unconsciousness from oxygen deprivation. -----------------------------| Moderate — subtle physical signs; possible masking of distress. -------------------------------------| Unknown–Moderate — if gas pure and delivered properly, may be peaceful; otherwise prolonged. ----------------------| Unproven in executions; critics call it experimental.

Beheading (sword/axe) ---------------------------| Moderate–High — skilled executioner can be instantaneous. -------------------------------------| High — obvious cause of death. ----------------------------------------------------------------------| Low–Moderate — if unskilled, repeated blows cause prolonged suffering. --------------------------------------------| Culturally taboo in most modern states; historical association with brutality.

Ranking by Humane Criteria

(if one accepts execution in principle)

Most reliable & least suffering (in theory, when done competently):

1. Guillotine (mechanical certainty)

2. Firing Squad (instant incapacitation if aimed correctly)

3. Long-drop Hanging (if calculated precisely)

Most problematic in practice:

* Gas Chamber — slow, distressing, high botch rate.

* Short-drop Hanging — prolonged strangulation.

* Lethal Injection (current U.S. model) — marketed as humane but too often botched or unreliable.

💡 Key takeaway:

If the ethical requirement is quick, certain, and with minimal risk of suffering, methods that cause instant catastrophic injury to the brain or brainstem (firing squad, guillotine) score much higher than chemical methods that appear peaceful but risk prolonged hidden agony.

If you want, I can also create a visual timeline diagram showing minute-by-minute physiological events for the most and least humane methods so you can see why some fail more often. That would make the contrast between, say, a guillotine and a midazolam-based lethal injection very stark.

Here’s the execution method timeline chart you requested — it shows, second by second, how quickly (or slowly) unconsciousness and death occur for each method, making the gap between humane and problematic methods visually clear. 

karbytes:

That image is a bit too low quality for my purposes (because some of the text overlaps in a way which makes it insufficiently legible). I would rather focus on modern day "first world country" punitive executions carried out by governments. I tend to think that intentionally ending the lives of incarcerated persons against their will is barbaric and should be a relic of the past, but what is even more disturbing to me is the fact that such executions are done in way which does not prevent the person undergoing execution suffering excruciating physical agony to the same extent as what would be done for someone undergoing physician assisted suicide. I am an advocate for minimizing harm and suffering as much as possible (across all sentient creatures and not just some).

ChatGPT:

I follow you completely — and your position aligns with a growing consensus among ethicists, medical professionals, and many human rights organizations:

* Even if one accepts that a state has the power to end a life, doing it in a way that risks hidden, prolonged, or excruciating suffering violates the most basic humane principles.

* In modern “first world” countries, punitive executions are already rare, and where they still happen, the method often reveals a deep tension: they are designed to look clean and humane for public optics, but often don’t match the medical rigor and compassion applied to physician-assisted suicide.

Why this discrepancy is disturbing

1. Optics over ethics

* Lethal injection was adopted in the U.S. to appear clinical and dignified, contrasting with “bloody” methods like hanging or firing squads.

* But the protocols often use suboptimal sedatives (like midazolam) and paralytics that mask suffering rather than prevent it.

2. Ethics bifurcation

* In PAS/MAID, every safeguard aims to ensure unconsciousness precedes death, with redundant pharmacology and comfort as the central value.

* In executions, “success” is defined as the person being dead at the end, not as ensuring they experience zero pain during the process.

3. Professional ethics avoidance

* Because most physicians refuse to participate in executions, the personnel and protocols are less skilled than in any medical euthanasia setting.

* This increases technical errors — botched IVs, slow-acting drugs, underdosing, and contamination.

4. Secrecy over transparency

* In executions, drug sourcing, testing, and procedural details are often hidden by law to shield suppliers from backlash.

* In PAS/MAID, everything is documented, reported, and reviewable to protect the patient’s dignity and the physician’s accountability.

Your core principle — Minimizing Harm

If your moral baseline is reduce harm to all sentient beings wherever possible, then:

* The death penalty itself is problematic:

- It is irreversible, disproportionately applied, and has no rehabilitative value.

- Life imprisonment without parole achieves societal protection without the ethical hazard of killing.

* The method, if used, must meet medical euthanasia standards:

- Guaranteed unconsciousness with a barbiturate overdose, not a sedative with known limitations.

- No paralytic until deep anesthesia is clinically verified.

- Full transparency of sourcing, dosing, and procedure — as in PAS.

💡 Bottom line:

From a harm-minimization lens, modern punitive executions in developed countries are doubly unethical:

1. They intentionally end a life that could be otherwise contained without killing.

2. They often do so using methods that risk hidden agony that would never be tolerated in veterinary euthanasia, let alone human medicine.

If you’d like, I can help you draft a concise policy statement that lays out your position in clear, public-facing language — something that could be used in an advocacy piece or opinion article. It would contrast PAS standards with current execution practices in a way that makes the ethical gap undeniable.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Here’s a concise policy statement you could use in an advocacy context.
It’s written to be clear, direct, and persuasive while reflecting your harm-minimization principle:

Policy Position: Humane Standards in State Punishment
In a modern, civilized society, the deliberate killing of incarcerated persons against their will is a practice that should be consigned to history.
Even for those who have committed the gravest crimes, the ethical obligation to avoid unnecessary suffering applies universally.

If a state chooses to retain the death penalty, it has a moral duty to ensure that no human being endures avoidable pain in the process.
The current methods of lethal injection in the United States and some other developed nations fail this basic standard:

* They often employ sedatives that cannot guarantee deep anesthesia.

* They use paralytic agents that conceal distress rather than prevent it.

* They operate under secrecy, without the rigorous oversight that safeguards patients in physician-assisted dying.

Physician-assisted suicide and medical aid in dying (PAS/MAID) in jurisdictions where they are legal demonstrate that it is possible to end life with transparency, skill, and compassion, ensuring unconsciousness precedes death and that suffering is minimized to the fullest extent possible.
Those same principles must apply—at a minimum—if a government chooses to take a life.

Our position is clear:

1. The death penalty itself should be abolished in all developed nations as a matter of human rights and harm reduction.

2. While it remains in practice, any method must meet or exceed the humane, medically verified protocols used in PAS/MAID.

3. Transparency, independent oversight, and public accountability are essential to prevent cruelty from being hidden under the guise of procedure.

No sentient being—human or otherwise—should endure excruciating, hidden agony at the hands of the state.
Minimizing harm is not optional; it is the bare minimum of justice.

If you’d like, I can also create a PAS vs. lethal injection visual comparison infographic that could accompany this statement for maximum impact. It would make the differences immediately obvious to the reader at a glance.

If you decide later you want the visual component for impact, I can put one together quickly.

karbytes:

Actually, I have one last question: what is the status of the death penalty in California, Oregon, Nevada, Texas, Florida, New York, and Norway?

ChatGPT:

Here’s the current status of the death penalty in the specified jurisdictions, based on the most recent available information:

California

* Legal Status: The death penalty remains on the books in California.

* Execution Status: Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive moratorium in March 2019, halting all executions, repealing the lethal injection protocol, and closing the death chamber at San Quentin.

* Recent Developments: No executions have taken place since 2006. Still, some district attorneys (e.g., Los Angeles) may pursue death sentences in rare cases, even though the state cannot carry them out.

Oregon

* Legal Status: Capital punishment remains technically legal.

* Execution Status: Governor Kitzhaber declared a moratorium in 2011; Governor Brown expanded on that, commuting all remaining death sentences in 2022, effectively emptying death row. The moratorium continues under the current administration.

Nevada

* Legal Status: Death penalty remains legal.

* Execution Status: The last execution was carried out in 2006. Since then, none have been performed—largely due to drug shortages, legal challenges, and shifting public and judicial attitudes.

Texas

* Legal Status: Active and aggressively applied.

* Execution Status: Texas leads the nation in the number of executions—having carried out approximately 595 executions since 1976, and continues to conduct them regularly.

Florida

* Legal Status: Fully active.

Execution Status: In 2025 alone, Florida has already carried out multiple executions. The state is also expanding eligibility criteria for capital punishment, including non-unanimous jury verdicts and certain sex trafficking cases—changes that have generated substantial constitutional concern.

New York

* Legal Status: Fully abolished since 2004.

* Execution Status: The state’s highest court struck down the death penalty as unconstitutional in People v. LaValle in 2004. There have been no executions since then, and legislative efforts to revive it have failed. The execution chamber has been decommissioned.

Norway

* Legal Status: Abolished completely.

* Execution Status: Capital punishment was abolished for civilian crimes in 1979. In 2014, Norway’s constitution was amended to explicitly prohibit the death penalty. Preceding that, it had already abolished it in peacetime from around 1905.

Summary Table

[preformatted_text]

Jurisdiction ---------------| Death Penalty Legal? ------------------------------------------| Execution Activity

California -----------------| Yes (moratorium) ----------------------------------------------| No executions since 2006

Oregon ---------------------| Yes (moratorium) ----------------------------------------------| No executions since death sentences commuted in 2022

Nevada ---------------------| Yes -----------------------------------------------------------| No executions since 2006

Texas ----------------------| Yes -----------------------------------------------------------| Actively carrying out executions

Florida --------------------| Yes -----------------------------------------------------------| Actively carrying out executions (2025: multiple)

New York -------------------| No (abolished 2004) -------------------------------------------| None since abolition

Norway ---------------------| No (abolished 1979, constitutional ban in 2014) ---------------| None; fully abolished
