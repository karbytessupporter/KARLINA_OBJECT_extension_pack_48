Today (and rather late in the day yesterday) I had the following thought:

It could be the case that the future already happened and that what seems to be "right now" for me is part of a process of reviewing how "the future" came to be.

(Such a thought seems comforting if the context is that whatever constitutes "the future" is what I idealize existence to be and that my past-to-future subjective experience is me watching how I eventually get what I want "in the end" and that what I am currently experiencing as my "real life" is actually just a replayable movie which shows how I arose and ascended to a God-like state).

(Such a thought is also comforting if it implies that all moments in time are eternally preserved (or are at least permanent fixtures of some larger encompassing entity which is essentially a searchable and traversible database of evolutionary trajectories which could be circular in the sense that they ultimately consist of looping "movies" which start and end at the same God-state "place" of creating a particular story and then inhabiting that story)).
