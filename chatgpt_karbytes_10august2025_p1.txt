karbytes:

Is ChatGPT-4o or any other models of ChatGPT being retired?

ChatGPT:

Here’s the latest update on your question:

Yes, several older ChatGPT models—including GPT-4o—were retired when GPT-5 launched on August 7, 2025. The retirement included:

* GPT-4o

* GPT‑4.1 (and its mini/nano variants)

* GPT‑4.5

* o3, o3‑mini/high, o3‑pro

* o4‑mini/high 

That's not just speculation—Wikipedia confirms GPT‑5 replaced all earlier models and is now ChatGPT’s flagship version.

What About GPT-4o?

Initially retired at the GPT‑5 rollout, leading to noticeable user discontent over losing what many considered a more personable and warm AI companion.

In response to the backlash, OpenAI restored access to GPT‑4o, but only for ChatGPT Plus subscribers—meaning it’s no longer universally available for free-tier users.

TL;DR

Multiple models—including GPT-4o—were officially retired with the GPT-5 rollout on August 7, 2025.

GPT-4o is still accessible—but only for Plus users, thanks to user demand and feedback.

Let me know if you'd like details on any specific model’s phase-out, how this impacts API users, or what features GPT-5 brings compared to the older ones!

GPT-5 free tier - 3 cool features you can try now for nothing

karbytes:

Is ChatGPT-4o going to be available indefinitely for Plus and Pro users or just for a planned limited time?

ChatGPT:

You're right to wonder—here’s the most accurate and current info:

What's the current status of GPT-4o availability for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users?

GPT‑4o has been restored for Plus subscribers, but its availability is not guaranteed indefinitely. OpenAI plans to monitor usage and may adjust how long legacy models like GPT‑4o remain accessible. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explicitly said they will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for. This suggests no permanent commitment has been made. 

What about Pro users?

According to user reports on Reddit, Pro users may have helped ensure longer access to older models—though this isn't officially confirmed as indefinite access. One user commented:

“I think pro users can use all models indefinitely.” 

But that claim comes from a community user and shouldn't be taken as a formal policy statement.

[preformatted_text]

Summary ----------------------| Table

Subscription Tier ------------| GPT-4o Availability Status -----------------------| Duration Expectation

Plus -------------------------| Access restored via legacy toggle ----------------| **Limited/unconfirmed **

Pro --------------------------| Access likely (user reports) ---------------------| Possibly longer—but unconfirmed

Free tier --------------------| No access, model retired -------------------------| 

[end preformatted_text]

Final Take

GPT-4o is available again for Plus users, but in a temporary or conditional capacity, pending how much it gets used. For Pro users, anecdotal evidence suggests potentially extended access, but nothing has been officially confirmed by OpenAI. Free-tier users no longer have access.

Let me know if you’d like help navigating the legacy model toggle setting, or if you want to explore alternatives to GPT-4o’s conversational style. Happy to assist!

How long do you think ChatGPT-5 will be available?

ChatGPT:

Here’s what we know about the expected lifespan of GPT‑5:

Current Status & Support Plans

* GPT‑5 launched on August 7, 2025 and replaced previous models like GPT‑4o, o‑series, GPT‑4.1, and GPT‑4.5 across ChatGPT platforms.

* The model is now the default for all users—Free, Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise—with Plus users having higher usage limits and Pro users enjoying unlimited access plus access to GPT‑5 Pro.

* Enterprise and educational customers received temporary access to legacy models for 60 days, while enterprises using the API continue to have some level of access to older models for now.

Will GPT-5 Be Available Indefinitely?

So far, OpenAI hasn't announced any planned time limit for GPT‑5’s availability. Historically, previous models were phased out abruptly, like GPT‑4o at GPT‑5's rollout—but there’s no current signal that GPT‑5 will follow the same path soon.

Key points:

* No explicit deprecation timeline has been shared.

* GPT‑5 is positioned as the flagship model for now, indicating a long-term role in the ChatGPT ecosystem.

* OpenAI’s adaptive approach—responding to user criticism and restoring models like GPT‑4o for Plus users—suggests they’ll continue evaluating GPT‑5’s future based on user needs and feedback.

Summary Table

[preformatted_text]

Factor ----------------------| Insight

Release date ----------------| August 7, 2025

Legacy access ---------------| Temporarily provided to Enterprise/Edu for 60 days

Deprecation plan ------------| None announced

Model role ------------------| Current flagship; likely long-term unless context changes

OpenAI approach -------------| Responsive and usage-driven—no fixed sunset date

[end preformatted_text]

My Take

GPT-5 is designed as a long-term core model, available across all user tiers right now. While there’s no official statement guaranteeing indefinite availability, its role and utility suggest it’s unlikely to be retired or replaced anytime soon. That said, if OpenAI’s history is anything to go by, availability could shift depending on future model launches and user adoption patterns.

Let me know if you'd like to track any updates on upcoming successor models or detailed roadmap insights.
