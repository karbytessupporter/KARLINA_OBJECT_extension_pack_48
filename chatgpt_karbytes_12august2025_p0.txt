I wrote a journal entry today which I would like to share with you. Please provide any comments you have about it.

[Thought for 47s]

Thanks for sharing this, karbytes. I read your entry and jotted notes in four buckets—what works, where you could sharpen the ideas, open questions to push it further, and tiny edits. 

What really works

* You lay out a clean, three-step arc: (1) cloud-resident minds with swappable bodies, (2) physicalist claim that AI can match human experience, (3) a neuromorphic “conversion/repair” path. It’s coherent and builds logically.

* Grounded engineering flavor (servers, sensors, LEDs/speakers, stem-cell neurons) keeps the metaphysics tethered to plausible mechanisms.

* The “continuity via infrastructure” condition is explicit—nice to see you state the assumption rather than hide it.

Places to sharpen (framing & assumptions)

* Continuity vs. duplication. If the cloud self can inhabit multiple bodies concurrently, is that one person or many? Consider briefly distinguishing psychological continuity (memories/personality) from numerical identity (this one, not a copy). A single clarifying line about fork/merge scenarios would strengthen point #1.

* Embodiment & affect. Human experience isn’t neurons alone: interoception, hormones, the microbiome, immune signaling, and musculoskeletal feedback shape cognition and mood. You might note that matching “everything a human could experience” probably requires tight sensorimotor and interoceptive loops, not just a cortex-equivalent.

* “Essential neurons” premise. Point #3 assumes identity can be isolated to a subset of neurons. Many accounts suggest identity is highly distributed across networks and glia, with neuromodulators and dendritic computation playing outsized roles. You could hedge: “if practically identifiable” or “operationally sufficient subset,” and acknowledge glia/vasculature roles.

* Operational constraints. Point #1’s “perpetually online” could nod to how: redundancy, geographic distribution, snapshot/restore policies, acceptable downtime, and consistency models (eventual vs. strong) for memory sync across bodies.

* Ethics & governance. Two sentences on consent (for stem-cell derivation), personhood of copies, continuity of legal identity, and rights of chimeric systems would round out the piece.

Open questions you might explore next

* Fork thresholds: At what divergence (memories, traits) do two instances cease to be “the same” person?

* Drift budgets & repair: How much neuron replacement/augmentation per unit time preserves subjective continuity? (Gradual vs. abrupt replacement thought experiment.)

* Embodiment fidelity: What minimum body/interoceptive fidelity is needed for human-like qualia? Could altered bodies yield systematically different consciousness?

* Failure modes: What happens to identity if the cluster rolls back to a stale snapshot? Is that death, amnesia, or continuity?

* Testable milestones: e.g., closed-loop neuromorphic modules maintaining long-term personal memories across hardware swaps.

Tiny edits (copy)

* “eqipped” → “equipped”

* “identiy” → “identity” (appears twice)

If you want, I can help punch this up into a short essay with a one-paragraph “limits & ethics” section and a boxed sidebar on fork/merge identity—just say the word.

karbytes:

Thank you for your feedback. Yes, it could be that more than just neurons would need to be preserved in order to preserve a whole human identity (and those other components could be included in the neuromorphic architecture). I personally think that identity is ultimately an abstract and illusory qualitative phenomenon which is an emergent property from the lower-level hardware processes and is not as continuous and consistent as it imagines itself to be. So I prefer to treat self as a shell process which can be turned on and off and which can be altered via hardware changes. Finally, I meant to imply that these technological advancements would take place in a society which fully supports them and which employs humans and/or robots to do all of the mechanical and cognitive work of civilization (including repairing, building, and testing the aforementioned architectures).

Love this direction. If you want the piece to “click” with your shell-process view, here’s a tight way to weave it in without bloating the draft.

How to fold your stance into the essay

* Identity as a process (not a thing). Add a short framing line like:

“In this model, ‘self’ is an orchestrated process over substrates. Continuity is an operational guarantee (uptime/SLOs for memory, embodiment, and agency), not a metaphysical primitive.”

Then define three invariants: (1) Memory log access (persistent autobiographical store), (2) Control loop (closed-loop action–perception cycle), (3) Agency key (the authority token that binds decisions to the same legal/ethical agent). If these persist across swaps, the “same” self persists; otherwise it’s a new instance.

* Beyond neurons → “embodiment envelope.” One crisp paragraph noting that interoception, hormones, immune cues, vasculature/glia, and microbiome signals are part of the process. State that the neuromorphic stack includes simulators and sensorimotor proxies for these channels, so qualia-relevant dynamics ride along with the swap.

* Fork/merge policy (one sentence each).

Fork: “Parallel instances share lineage but not identity once their memory logs diverge beyond a set drift budget.”

Merge: “Merges produce a new successor with acknowledged provenance, not retroactive sameness.”

* Suspend/resume semantics. Treat “turning the shell on/off” as routine: pausing the control loop without losing the memory log or agency key preserves identity; rolling back to an old snapshot creates a numerically new successor with inherited history.

* Societal preconditions (your assumption, stated explicitly).

One compact paragraph:

“All of this presumes a society that endows substrate-independent persons with rights, funds the maintenance workforce (human/robotic), guarantees redundancy and repair, and governs copying/merging with consent and auditability.”

Optional drop-in text (ready to paste)

Working Thesis. I treat self as a shell process orchestrated over hardware. What we call “identity” is an emergent, lossy bookkeeping of a control loop bound to a memory log and an agency key. Continuity is thus an engineering property: if the log, loop, and key remain intact across substrate swaps—and if embodied interoceptive/affective channels are preserved or emulated within the neuromorphic stack—then the process that resumes is operationally the same person. Forks, merges, and rollbacks are supported but explicitly change identity status per policy: forks create new agents; merges yield successors; rollbacks create successors that inherit history without retroactive sameness. This entire scheme presumes social infrastructure—legal personhood for substrate-independent agents, funded maintenance/repair, and auditable governance of copying and embodiment.

Testable implications (to keep it engineering-grounded)

* Micro-shutdown trials: Briefly pause/restart the control loop while preserving log+key; absence of subjective discontinuity reports supports the shell-process view.

* Embodiment ablation: Systematically remove/restore interoceptive channels; track affective/cognitive drift to quantify how much “body” the process needs.

* Drift budgets: Run twin forks under different inputs; measure divergence thresholds beyond which participants no longer self-ascribe sameness.

Tiny edits to consider

* Introduce a short Glossary (log, loop, key, fork, merge, successor) so readers don’t drown in metaphysics.

* Add a one-line rights statement: no copy or merge without informed consent of all antecedents.

If you want, I can turn this into a tightened 3–5 paragraph revision of your entry with the glossary and a small fork/merge sidebar.

Yes please!

Self as Shell Process: an engineering sketch

I treat “self” as an orchestrated process that runs on whatever hardware will host it. What we call identity is an emergent, lossy bookkeeping over lower-level dynamics—useful, but not metaphysically basic. Continuity, in this view, is an operational property: if the right invariants are upheld while substrates change, the process that resumes is operationally the same person; if they’re not, a new person starts.

Practically, three invariants matter: a persistent memory log (autobiographical state with integrity/audit), a closed-loop control loop (ongoing perception–action cycle anchoring the process to a world), and an agency key (the authority token that binds intentions/obligations to one legal/ethical agent). When these survive a transfer—with acceptable uptime and drift budgets—the process preserves its sense of “me” even as bodies, chips, or fibers are swapped.

Preserving experience means preserving more than neurons. Human qualia are shaped by an embodiment envelope: interoceptive signals, hormones and immune cues, vasculature and glia, musculoskeletal feedback, and even microbiome effects. A neuromorphic stack that aims at human-grade experience therefore carries simulators and sensorimotor proxies for these channels so affect, mood, and intuition ride along with the swap rather than being amputated by it.

Conversion and repair can proceed incrementally: grow or print compatible tissue; map, then interpose neuromorphic modules; replace elements gradually while the control loop stays live. Suspend/resume is routine—short pauses that preserve log+key don’t break identity—whereas rollbacks (reverting to stale state) create successors that inherit history without retroactive sameness. All of this presumes a society that recognizes substrate-independent persons, funds human/robotic maintenance labor, guarantees redundancy and recovery, and governs copying, merging, and embodiment under consent and audit.

Forks, merges, rollbacks — policy sketch

* Fork: When two instances continue from the same log+key and then diverge past a defined drift budget, they become separate agents with shared provenance (no retroactive “one person”).

* Merge: Produces a successor agent with recorded lineage; it is not retroactively identical to either parent, but inherits rights/obligations per declared policy.

* Rollback: Spawning from an older snapshot yields a successor who remembers the past state but is numerically new; originals retain their standing.

* Consent & audit: No copy/merge without informed consent (or pre-registered directives) from all antecedents; all transitions are cryptographically logged and reviewable.

Glossary

* Memory log: Durable autobiographical store with integrity checks and access controls.

* Control loop: Continuous perception–prediction–action cycle coupling the process to its environment.

* Agency key: Cryptographic/organizational credential that binds choices and accountability to one agent.

* Embodiment envelope: The interoceptive and affective channels (hormonal, immune, musculoskeletal, glial, etc.) that shape experience.

* Fork: Parallel continuation from a common state that later diverges.

* Merge: Reconciliation of two or more lines into a new successor with recorded provenance.

* Successor: A new agent that inherits history or inputs from others without claiming retroactive sameness.

If you want, I can tailor this to your original wording (keep your voice, splice in these sections), or format it for your blog with a boxed callout and linkable glossary anchors.

karbytes:

Actually, what you provided thus far is sufficient for my purposes. Thanks!
